## About xyd-js

**xyd** is a modern, batteries-included documentation engine that redefines the documentation experience by making it intuitive, flexible, and enjoyable. Built for developers who want to create beautiful documentation quickly.

## Features

- âš¡ **Fast Development** - Hot reload with instant preview
- ðŸŽ¨ **Modern Design** - Beautiful, responsive documentation sites
- ðŸ“š **Rich Content** - Support for markdown, code blocks, and interactive components
- ðŸ”— **API Integration** - Built-in OpenAPI/Swagger documentation support
- ðŸš€ **Easy Deployment** - Static site generation for any hosting platform
- ðŸŽ¯ **Developer Friendly** - Simple CLI and configuration

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.

### Installation

Install the xyd-js CLI globally:

```bash
npm i -g xyd-js
```

### Development

Run the development server at the root of your documentation (where `docs.json` is located):

```bash
xyd
```

This will start a local development server with hot reload enabled. Your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the next available port).

### Building for Production

Generate static files for deployment:

```bash
xyd build
```

This produces static files within `.xyd/build/client` which you can deploy to any static hosting platform.

## Project Structure

```
starter/
â”œâ”€â”€ docs.json              # Main configuration file
â”œâ”€â”€ openapi.json           # OpenAPI specification
â”œâ”€â”€ netlify.toml          # Netlify deployment configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                 # Documentation pages
â”œâ”€â”€ api-reference/        # API reference pages
â”œâ”€â”€ public/              # Static assets
```

## Configuration

The main configuration file `docs.json` controls:

- **Theme**: Customize colors, logos, and branding
- **Navigation**: Header and sidebar structure
- **API Reference**: OpenAPI integration settings
- **Banner**: Custom announcements and notifications

## Deployment

### Netlify

This starter kit includes a `netlify.toml` configuration for easy deployment on Netlify:

1. Connect your repository to Netlify
2. The build command and publish directory are already configured
3. Deploy automatically on every push to your main branch

### Other Platforms

Since xyd-js generates static files, you can deploy to any static hosting platform:

- **Vercel**: Connect your repository and deploy
- **GitHub Pages**: Push to a `gh-pages` branch
- **AWS S3**: Upload the `.xyd/build/client` directory
- **Any CDN**: Serve the static files from your preferred provider

## Customization

### Adding Pages

Create new markdown files in the `docs/` directory and update the navigation in `docs.json`.

### Styling

Customize the theme by modifying the `theme` section in `docs.json`:

```json
{
  "theme": {
    "name": "picasso",
    "logo": {
      "light": "/public/assets/logo.svg",
      "dark": "/public/assets/logo-dark.svg"
    }
  }
}
```

### API Documentation

Add your OpenAPI specification to `openapi.json` and configure the API reference in `docs.json`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Dev server won't start**: Run `xyd install` to reinstall dependencies
- **Page loads as 404**: Make sure you're running the command in a folder with `docs.json`
- **Build fails**: Check that all referenced files exist and are properly formatted
- **Styling issues**: Verify that your theme configuration in `docs.json` is valid
